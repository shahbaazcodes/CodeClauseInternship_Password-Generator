# 🔐 Simple Password Generator (Python Project)

This is a basic password generator I created during my internship to practice Python programming and build a small, useful tool. The goal was to let users generate secure passwords with options like uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.

## 📌 What It Does

The script asks you what kind of characters you want in your password, how long it should be, and then generates one instantly.

### ✨ Features:
- You can choose:
  - Password length (min 6 characters)
  - Whether to include:
    - ✅ Uppercase letters
    - ✅ Numbers
    - ✅ Special characters
- Gives a random, strong password based on your choices
- Easy to use from the terminal
